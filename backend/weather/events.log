Immediate sensor calibration and validation checks are a reasonable and safe action to take when anomalies are detected, as it helps to identify and correct any potential issues that may be affecting system performance or accuracy. This action is also effective in addressing the medium-severity anomaly, allowing for enhanced monitoring and potential operational adjustments to be made.

The agent's recommended action is reasonable, safe, and effective because it acknowledges the presence of anomalies and prepares for potential future issues by developing contingency response plans. This proactive approach helps to mitigate potential risks and ensures the system is prepared to respond to any unexpected events.
