Immediate sensor calibration and validation checks are a reasonable and safe action to take when anomalies are detected, as it helps to identify and correct any potential issues that may be affecting system performance or accuracy. This action is also effective in addressing the medium-severity anomaly, allowing for enhanced monitoring and potential operational adjustments to be made.

The recommended action of placing response teams on standby is a reasonable and proactive measure to address the detected anomalies. It allows for a swift response in case the situation escalates, while also not overreacting to the current medium-severity anomalies.
